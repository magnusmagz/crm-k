# Manager/Team View Feature

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED & TESTED

---

## Summary

Managers can now view and filter their team members' contacts and deals. The feature includes:
- Manager role with team visibility permissions
- Team member filter in Pipeline view
- API filtering by specific team members or all team data
- Automatic permission checking based on organization membership

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Database Schema

**Users Table - New Field:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_manager BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

This field indicates whether a user has manager permissions to view team data.

#### Updated API Endpoints

**Contacts API** (`backend/routes/contacts.js`)
- Modified `GET /api/contacts` to support `ownerId` query parameter
- Managers see all contacts from their organization by default
- Can filter by specific team member using `?ownerId={userId}`
- Regular users only see their own contacts

**Deals API** (`backend/routes/deals.js`)
- Modified `GET /api/deals` to support `ownerId` query parameter
- Managers see all deals from their organization by default
- Can filter by specific team member using `?ownerId={userId}`
- Analytics update to reflect filtered view
- Regular users only see their own deals

**New Team Members Endpoint**
- `GET /api/users/team-members` - Returns list of users in the manager's organization
- Only accessible to managers
- Returns user ID, email, full name, and role information

#### Authorization Logic

```javascript
// Backend logic for managers
if (ownerId) {
  // Filter by specific team member
  // Verify team member is in same organization
  where.userId = ownerId;
} else if (isManager && organizationId) {
  // Show all team data
  where.userId = { [Op.in]: teamUserIds };
} else {
  // Regular user: only own data
  where.userId = currentUserId;
}
```

#### Updated Models

**User Model** (`backend/models/User.js`)
```javascript
isManager: {
  type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
  allowNull: true,
  defaultValue: false,
  field: 'is_manager'
}
```

---

### 2. Frontend Changes

**Pipeline Page** (`frontend/src/pages/Pipeline.tsx`)

#### New State Management
```typescript
const [ownerFilter, setOwnerFilter] = useState<string>('all');
const [teamMembers, setTeamMembers] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [isManager, setIsManager] = useState(false);
```

#### Team Members Fetching
```typescript
const fetchTeamMembers = async () => {
  const response = await api.get('/users/team-members');
  setTeamMembers(response.data.teamMembers || []);
  setIsManager(true);
};
```

#### API Call with Owner Filter
```typescript
const params: any = { status: statusFilter, limit: 500 };

if (ownerFilter === 'me' && user?.id) {
  params.ownerId = user.id;
} else if (ownerFilter !== 'all' && ownerFilter !== 'me') {
  params.ownerId = ownerFilter;
}
```

#### Owner Filter UI
```tsx
{mode === 'sales' && isManager && teamMembers.length > 0 && (
  <select
    value={ownerFilter}
    onChange={(e) => setOwnerFilter(e.target.value)}
    className="..."
  >
    <option value="all">All Team Members</option>
    <option value="me">My Deals Only</option>
    {teamMembers.map((member) => (
      <option key={member.id} value={member.id}>
        {member.fullName}
      </option>
    ))}
  </select>
)}
```

---

## Usage

### For Managers

1. **Login** as a manager user
2. **Navigate** to Pipeline or Contacts
3. **See** the owner filter dropdown next to the status filter
4. **Filter** by:
   - **All Team Members** - View all team contacts/deals
   - **My Deals Only** - View only your own contacts/deals
   - **[Team Member Name]** - View specific team member's contacts/deals

### For Non-Managers

- No changes to the UI
- Users continue to see only their own contacts and deals
- No access to team member filtering

---

## Setup Instructions

### Setting Up a Manager for Testing

Run the setup script:
```bash
node setup-manager-test.js
```

This will:
1. Create an organization (if needed)
2. Set test@example.com as a manager
3. Add any other existing users to the same organization

### Manual Setup

To manually set a user as manager:
```sql
-- Create an organization
INSERT INTO organizations (id, name, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'My Company', NOW(), NOW());

-- Set user as manager
UPDATE users
SET is_manager = true,
    organization_id = '[organization-id]'
WHERE email = 'manager@example.com';

-- Add team members to organization
UPDATE users
SET organization_id = '[organization-id]'
WHERE email IN ('team-member1@example.com', 'team-member2@example.com');
```

---

## Testing

### Test Script

Run the test script to check current setup:
```bash
node test-manager-feature.js
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Create multiple users** in the same organization
2. **Set one user as manager** using the setup script
3. **Login as the manager**
4. **Create contacts/deals** for different users
5. **Test filtering:**
   - Select "All Team Members" - should see all contacts/deals
   - Select "My Deals Only" - should see only manager's contacts/deals
   - Select specific team member - should see that member's contacts/deals
6. **Verify analytics** update correctly based on filter

## Security Considerations

### âœ… Implemented

1. **Organization-Based Access Control**
   - Managers can only view data from users in their organization
   - Cross-organization access is blocked

2. **Role-Based Permissions**
   - Only managers can use the `ownerId` filter
   - Non-managers receive 403 Forbidden if they try to access other users' data

3. **Team Member Validation**
   - Backend verifies requested team member is in same organization
   - Invalid user IDs return 403 errors

4. **Manager Status Verification**
   - Team members endpoint requires manager role
   - Manager status checked on every request

### ðŸ”„ Future Enhancements

1. **Audit Logging**
   - Log when managers view other users' data
   - Track filter usage patterns

2. **Granular Permissions**
   - Different manager levels (view only, edit team data)
   - Department-level filtering

3. **Privacy Controls**
   - Allow users to mark certain contacts/deals as private
   - Exclude private data from manager views

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/models/User.js` - Added `isManager` field
- `backend/routes/contacts.js` - Added manager filtering logic
- `backend/routes/deals.js` - Added manager filtering logic
- `backend/routes/users.js` - Added team members endpoint

### Test/Setup Scripts
- `test-manager-feature.js` - Test script to check current setup
- `setup-manager-test.js` - Setup script to configure manager for testing

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Owner filter not showing

**Solution:** Check that:
- User has `is_manager = true`
- User has `organization_id` set
- Other users exist in the same organization
- Run `setup-manager-test.js` to configure

### Issue: "Only managers can view other users' contacts" error

**Solution:**
- Verify user has manager permissions: `SELECT is_manager FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email';`
- Check organization ID is set
- Ensure you're logged in as the correct user

### Issue: Filter shows "All Team Members" but no team members listed

**Solution:**
- Add other users to the same organization
- Run setup script again after creating new users
- Check organization_id matches for all team members

### Issue: Analytics don't update when filtering

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API response includes analytics object

4. **Monitor Performance** - Team queries may be slower than individual queries
5. **Backup Database** - Backup before running migration

### Deployment Steps

1. **Add is_manager column:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_manager BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
   ```

2. **Deploy backend code** with updated routes and models

3. **Deploy frontend code** with new owner filter UI

4. **Configure managers:**
   ```bash
   heroku run node setup-manager-test.js --app your-app-name
   ```

5. **Test in production:**
   - Login as manager
   - Verify filter works
   - Check team data visibility

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Setup** - Run `node test-manager-feature.js`
2. **Review Logs** - Check browser console and server logs
3. **Verify Database** - Check users table for correct organization_id and is_manager values
4. **Test API** - Use curl or Postman to test endpoints directly

---

## Conclusion
