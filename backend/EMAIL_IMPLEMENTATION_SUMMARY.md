## üìã Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Locally (requires PostgreSQL running)
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

# On Heroku
heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:migrate --app maggie-crm
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables on Heroku
```bash
heroku config:set POSTMARK_API_KEY=your-production-key --app maggie-crm
heroku config:set EMAIL_DOMAIN=notifications.crmapp.io --app maggie-crm
```

### 3. Deploy to Heroku
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add email sending functionality with Postmark"
git push heroku main
```

## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### Send Email
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/emails/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contactId": "contact-uuid-here",
    "subject": "Test Email",
    "message": "Hello from the CRM!"
  }'
```

### Get Email History
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/emails/contact/CONTACT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Webhook URL for Postmark
Configure in Postmark dashboard:
```
https://your-app.herokuapp.com/api/webhooks/postmark
```

## üìù Notes

1. The implementation uses Postmark's test API key by default (`POSTMARK_API_TEST`)
2. Emails are sent from `userName <noreply@EMAIL_DOMAIN>` with reply-to set to user's actual email
3. The webhook handler processes Open, Bounce, and Delivery events
4. All email endpoints require authentication except the webhook
5. Users can only send emails to their own contacts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

Before testing locally, ensure:
1. PostgreSQL is running
2. Database migrations have been run
3. Environment variables are set in `.env` file

The implementation follows all requirements from the task specifications and is ready for deployment once the database migration is run.
