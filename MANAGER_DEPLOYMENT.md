## 📱 How to Use in Production

### Setting Up a Manager

**Option 1: Via Heroku Console**
```bash
heroku run node -e "const { User } = require('./backend/models'); User.findOne({ where: { email: 'your-email@example.com' } }).then(u => u.update({ isManager: true })).then(() => process.exit(0));" --app maggie-crm
```

**Option 2: Via Database SQL**
```sql
-- Set a user as manager
UPDATE users
SET is_manager = true
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### User Experience Flow

**For Managers:**
1. Login to https://maggie-crm-088fbe4fea30.herokuapp.com/
2. Navigate to Pipeline view
3. See owner filter dropdown (next to status filter)
4. Select filter option:
   - "All Team Members" - View all team deals
   - "My Deals Only" - View only your deals
   - Select team member name - View that person's deals

**For Regular Users:**
- No changes - continues to see only own deals
- Owner filter not visible

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Production Testing

- [ ] **Login** with manager account
- [ ] **Verify** owner filter is visible in Pipeline
- [ ] **Test** "All Team Members" filter
- [ ] **Test** "My Deals Only" filter
- [ ] **Test** individual team member filter
- [ ] **Verify** analytics update based on filter
- [ ] **Check** no cross-organization data leakage

### Setup Required Before Testing

You need at least 2 users in the same organization:

```bash
# 1. Set first user as manager
UPDATE users SET is_manager = true WHERE email = 'manager@example.com';

# 2. Add other users to same organization
UPDATE users
SET organization_id = (SELECT organization_id FROM users WHERE email = 'manager@example.com')
WHERE email IN ('user1@example.com', 'user2@example.com');
```

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Implemented Controls

1. **Organization-Based Access**
   - Managers only see users in their organization
   - Cross-organization access blocked (403 Forbidden)

2. **Role-Based Permissions**
   - Only managers can use ownerId filter
   - Non-managers get 403 if accessing other users' data
   - Team members endpoint requires manager role

3. **Data Validation**
   - Backend verifies team member is in same organization
   - Invalid user IDs return 403 errors
   - Manager status checked on every request

```

### 2. Remove Database Column (if needed)

heroku run "node -e \"const { sequelize } = require('./backend/models'); sequelize.query('ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS is_manager').then(() => process.exit(0));\"" --app maggie-crm
```

### 3. Verify Rollback
```bash
heroku ps --app maggie-crm
heroku logs --tail --app maggie-crm
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Owner filter not showing

**Check:**
- User has `is_manager = true`
- User has `organization_id` set
- Other users exist in same organization

**Fix:**
```sql
UPDATE users SET is_manager = true WHERE email = 'manager@example.com';
```

### Issue: "Only managers can view other users' contacts"

**Check:**
- Verify manager permissions in database
- Check organization ID matches

**Fix:**
```sql
SELECT is_manager, organization_id FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email';
```

### Issue: No team members in dropdown

**Check:**
- Other users have same organization_id
- Users are active (is_active = true)

**Fix:**
```sql
UPDATE users
SET organization_id = 'org-id-here'
WHERE email IN ('user1@example.com', 'user2@example.com');
```
